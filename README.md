# Deep-Learning-Cell-Classification
This is the project in ELEC5622, which aimed to using AlexNet as a baseline model to classify cell images. 
In this project, we used Efficient Human Epithelial-2 (HEp-2) cell image dataset for classification, so that it can facilitate the diagnosis of many autoimmune diseases.
